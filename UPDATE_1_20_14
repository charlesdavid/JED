A MINOR update to JED and the JED User Manual was just done:

The manual now has a functional Table of Contents.

The Appendix contains Input File Format and Output File Format Examples.


****************SAMPLE INPUT FILES ARE IN THIS DIRECTORY*******************



Recall that the current verion of JED can handle just about any type of numbering scheme in your PDB files,
including starting with negative numbers and having missing residues.

It does this by reading the reference pdb file when loading your residue lists and creates a mapping from the pdb file to the coordinates matrix.

Thus it is CRITICAL that your reference PDB file be properly matched to your matrix of coordinates, i.e., it is one of the pdb files used to create it.


PLEASE SEND BUG REPORTS TO ccdavid@uncc.edu

Thanks for using JED and providing feedback so that it can be improved.
