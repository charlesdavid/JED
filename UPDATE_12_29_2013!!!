A major update to JED and the JED User Manual was just done:

The new manual has all the new input file formats with lots of examples.
Also, there is an appendix for Input File Formats and Output File Examples.

The .jar files that were uploaded today MUST be run with modified input files:

****************SAMPLE INPUT FILES ARE IN THIS DIRECTORY*******************

The JED input files now do NOT require you to enter ANY chain information for MULTI chain files.

Also, chain offsets are no longer required.

The current format is the SAME for BOTH SINGLE or MULTI formatted PDB files.

All that you need to do is specify multi chain pdb files with the usual flag: Set it to "1" or "multi".

Also, the new verion of JED can handle just about any type of numbering scheme in your PDB files,
including starting with negative numbers and having missing residues.

It does this by reading the reference pdb file when loading your residue lists and creates a mapping from the pdb file to the coordinates matrix.

Thus it is CRITICAL that your reference PDB file be matched to your matrix of coordinates, i.e., it is one of the pdb files used to create it.

There is much more error checking now, and if you do not have the input file right, JED wont let you proceed...
*********IT WILL GIVE FEEDBACK for what I could think of that would cause it to misbehave...

But I know I did not think of everything!

If you find bugs, PLEASE REPORT ASAP so that they can be sprayed.

Also, please examine the outputs carefully to assess the accuracy of the program.

Specifically, check that the correct residues are processed as requested and 
that the matrix of coordinates has the  correct coordinate values for the chosen residues.

Any other verification checks are greatly appreciated too.

Thanks for using JED and providing feedback so that it can be improved.
