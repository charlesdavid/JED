Reading the Reference PDB file: MVb_A_B_ATP.pdb

Reading alpha carbon coordinates from the reference PDB file.
The number of residues found in the Reference PDB file = 946
Reference coordinates matrix created: 'original_Reference_PDB_Coordinates'
The file All_PDB_Residues_Multi_JED.txt' contains all chainID-residue number pairs found in the PDB file, formatted for Multi Chain Analysis Input.

Performing Preliminary Processing Run.

Reading alpha carbon coordinates from all PDB files in the Working Directory
The number of PDB files read = 101
The number of residues found in the PDB files = 946
Coordinates Matrix created: 'original_PDB_Coordinates'
The dimension of the coordinates matrix is: 2838  by  101
PDB reference structure is MVb_A_B_ATP.pdb

Conformation RMSDs and Residue RMSDs (RMSF) were calculated.

PDB file with B-factors replaced by residue RMSDs: ss_946_RMSF_edited.pdb

Variable Z-scores were calculated.
