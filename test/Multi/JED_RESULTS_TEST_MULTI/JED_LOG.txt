Performing Cartesian Mode Visualization on Top  5  cPCA modes.
Sets of 20 structures were generated to animate each selected cPCA mode, for the COV, CORR, and PCORR PCA models.
A set of 20 structures was generated to animate the essential subspace composed of the top 5 modes for the COV, CORR, and PCORR PCA models.
For the individual modes, atoms of each residue were perturbed along the mode eigenvector using a sine function over one full period.
For the essential motion, a superposition was created spanning 2 full periods for the first mode.
Pymol(TM) scripts were generated for each individual mode and the essential subspace, to play the mode structures as movies.
MODE AMPLITUDE = 3.000

Performing Free Energy calculations using two order parameters on each PCA model: 
	The first and second PC (weighted-projection). 
See the FES Logs in the FES subdirectories of each PCA model for more details.
