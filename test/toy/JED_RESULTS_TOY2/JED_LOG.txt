READ PDBs =  true
MULTI CHAIN PDBs = false

Reading the Reference PDB file: test_toy2.pdb

Reading alpha carbon coordinates from the reference PDB file.
The number of residues found in the Reference PDB file = 11
Reference coordinates matrix created: 'original_Reference_PDB_Coordinates'
The file All_PDB_Residues_JED.txt' contains all residue numbers found in the PDB file, formatted for Single Chain Analysis Input.

Performing Preliminary Processing Run.

Reading alpha carbon coordinates from all PDB files in the Working Directory
The number of PDB files read = 3
The number of residues found in the PDB files = 11
Coordinates Matrix created: 'original_PDB_Coordinates'
The dimension of the coordinates matrix is: 33  by  3
The transformed PDB coordinates were obtained by quaternion least-squares alignment to the reference structure.
PDB reference structure is test_toy2.pdb

Conformation RMSDs and Residue RMSDs (RMSF) were calculated.

PDB file with B-factors replaced by residue RMSDs: ss_11_RMSF_edited.pdb

Variable Z-scores were calculated.
