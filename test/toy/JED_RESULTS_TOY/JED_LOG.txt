Performing Cartesian Mode Visualization on Top  3  cPCA modes.
Sets of 20 structures were generated to animate each selected cPCA mode, for the COV, CORR, and PCORR PCA models.
A set of 100 structures was generated to animate the essential subspace composed of the top 3 modes, for the COV, CORR, and PCORR PCA models.
For the individual modes, atoms of each residue were perturbed along the mode eigenvector using a sine function over a full period.
For the essential motion, atoms of each residue were perturbed along the mode eigenvector using a sine function over 5 full periods for the first mode.
Pymol(TM) scripts were generated for each individual mode and the combined subspace to play the mode structures as movies.
MODE AMPLITUDE = 1.500
