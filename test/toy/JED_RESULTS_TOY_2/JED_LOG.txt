READ PDBs =  false
MULTI CHAIN PDBs = false

Reading the Reference PDB file: test_toy2.pdb

Reading alpha carbon coordinates from the reference PDB file.
The number of residues found in the Reference PDB file = 11
Reference coordinates matrix created: 'original_Reference_PDB_Coordinates'
The file All_PDB_Residues_JED.txt' contains all residue numbers found in the PDB file, formatted for Single Chain Analysis Input.

The alpha carbon coordinates were obtained from coordinates matrix file: original_PDB_Coordinates.txt
The dimension of the coordinates matrix is = 33 by 3
Total number of residues in matrix = 11
Total number of conformations in matrix = 3
Transformed PDB coordinates obtained by quaternion least-squares alignment to the reference structure.
PDB reference structure is: test_toy2.pdb
