READ PDBs =  true
MULTI CHAIN PDBs = false

Reading alpha carbon coordinates from all PDB files in the Working Directory
The number of PDB files read = 2001
The number of residues found in the PDB files = 151
Coordinates Matrix created: 'original_PDB_Coordinates'
The dimension of the coordinates matrix is: 453  by  2001
The transformed PDB coordinates were obtained by quaternion least-squares alignment to the reference structure.
PDB reference structure is 1A6N.pdb
The column in the Coordinates Matrix that corresponds to the entered reference structure is:
	REFERENCE COLUMN =  0

The file 'All_PDB_Residues_JED.txt' contains all residue numbers found in the PDB file, formatted for Single Chain Analysis Input.

Performing Preliminary Processing Run (NO-PCA).

Conformation RMSDs and Residue RMSDs (RMSF) were calculated.

PDB file with B-factors replaced by residue RMSDs: ss_151_RMSF_edited.pdb
