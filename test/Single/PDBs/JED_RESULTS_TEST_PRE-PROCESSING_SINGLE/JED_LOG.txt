Reading the Reference PDB file: 1A6N.pdb

Reading alpha carbon coordinates from the reference PDB file.
The number of residues found in the Reference PDB file = 151
Reference coordinates matrix created: 'original_Reference_PDB_Coordinates'
The file All_PDB_Residues_JED.txt' contains all residue numbers found in the PDB file, formatted for Single Chain Analysis Input.

Performing Preliminary Processing Run.

Reading alpha carbon coordinates from all PDB files in the Working Directory
The number of PDB files read = 2001
The number of residues found in the PDB files = 151
Coordinates Matrix created: 'original_PDB_Coordinates'
The dimension of the coordinates matrix is: 453  by  2001
PDB reference structure is 1A6N.pdb

Conformation RMSDs and Residue RMSDs (RMSF) were calculated.

PDB file with B-factors replaced by residue RMSDs: ss_151_RMSF_edited.pdb

Variable Z-scores were calculated.
